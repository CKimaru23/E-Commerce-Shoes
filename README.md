The links are internal links that takes you to various parts of the page.
There is a dark-mode turner that changes on click.
Search and Profiles are deactivated to keep the website simple and not robust.
Then we have the shopping-bag that displays whatever have been added to the cart. It shows a page on click, that displays the products, quantitites and the total. One can clear the cart or checkout. But the checkout again is deactivated since we need to link to payment capabilities which can be done but not yet linked. One can as well remove individual product by clicking remove button. We try as much as possible to have one page that have no redirects to other pages.
